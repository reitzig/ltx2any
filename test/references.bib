  abstract = {Adaptation is important in dependable embedded systems to cope with
	changing environmental conditions. However, adaptation significantly
	complicates system design and poses new challenges to system correctness.
	We propose an integrated model-based development approach facilitating
	intuitive modelling as well as formal verification of dynamic adaptation
	behaviour. Our modelling concepts ease the specification of adaptation
	behaviour and improve the design of adaptive embedded systems by
	hiding the increased complexity from the developer. Based on a formal
	framework for representing adaptation behaviour, our approach allows
	to employ theorem proving, model checking as well as specialised
	verification techniques to prove properties characteristic for adaptive
	systems such as stability.},

  number = {1},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND:RNA secondary structure prediction methods based on probabilistic
	modeling can be developed using stochastic context-free grammars
	(SCFGs). Such methods can readily combine different sources of information
	that can be expressed probabilistically, such as an evolutionary
	model of comparative RNA sequence analysis and a biophysical model
	of structure plausibility. However, the number of free parameters
	in an integrated model for consensus RNA structure prediction can
	become untenable if the underlying SCFG design is too complex. Thus
	a key question is, what small, simple SCFG designs perform best for
	RNA secondary structure prediction?
	
	
	RESULTS:Nine different small SCFGs were implemented to explore the
	tradeoffs between model complexity and prediction accuracy. Each
	model was tested for single sequence structure prediction accuracy
	on a benchmark set of RNA secondary structures.
	
	
	CONCLUSIONS:Four SCFG designs had prediction accuracies near the performance
	of current energy minimization programs. One of these designs, introduced
	by Knudsen and Hein in their PFOLD algorithm, has only 21 free parameters
	and is significantly simpler than the others.},

	possesses inuence, e.g. on the interaction of tRNA molecules with
	proteins or on the stabilization of mRNA molecules. The classication
	of secondary structures by means of their order proved useful with
	respect to numerous applications. In 1978 Waterman, who gave the
	rst precise formal framework for the topic, suggested to determine
	the number a n;p of secondary structures of size n and given order
	p. Since then, no satisfactory result has been found. Based on an

	for the secondary structures of order p from generating functions
	for binary tree structures with Horton-Strahler number p. These generating
	functions enable us to compute a precise asymptotic equivalent for
	a n;p . Furthermore, we will determine the related number of structures
	when the number of unpaired bases shows up as an additional parameter.
	Our approach proves to be general enough to compute the average order
	of a secondary structure together with all the r-th moments and to
	enumerate substructures such as hairpins or bulges in dependence
	on the order of the secondary structures considered.},

  title = {{N}oninterference, transitivity and channel-control security policies},
  institution = {-},
  year = {1992},
  abstract = {We consider noninterference formulations of security policies [7]
	in
	
	which the “interferes” relation is intransitive. Such policies provide
	a
	
	formal basis for several real security concerns, such as channel control
	[17,
	
	18], and assured pipelines [4]. We show that the appropriate formulation
	
	of noninterference for the intransitive case is that developed by
	Haigh
	
	and Young for “multidomain security” (MDS) [9, 10]. We construct an
	
	“unwinding theorem” [8] for intransitive polices and show that it
	differs
	
	significantly from that of Haigh and Young. We argue that their theorem
	
	is incorrect. A companion report [22] presents a mechanically-checked
	
	formal specification and verification of our unwinding theorem.
	
	 We consider the relationship between transitive and intransitive
	for-
	
	mulations of security. We show that the standard formulations of non-
	
	interference and unwinding [7, 8] correspond exactly to our intransitive
	
	formulations, specialized to the transitive case. We show that transi-

	that any MLS secure system satisfies the conditions of the unwinding

	“reference monitor assumptions” that play a crucial role in establishing
	
	the soundness of access control implementations.},

  abstract = {A major challenge in the analysis of gene expression microarray data
	is to extract meaningful biological knowledge out of the huge volume
	of raw data. Expander (EXPression ANalyzer and DisplayER) is an integrated
	software platform for the analysis of gene expression data, which
	is freely available for academic use. It is designed to support all
	the stages of microarray data analysis, from raw data normalization
	to inference of transcriptional regulatory networks. The microarray
	analysis described in this protocol starts with importing the data
	into Expander 5.0 and is followed by normalization and filtering.
	Then, clustering and network-based analyses are performed. The gene
	groups identified are tested for enrichment in function (based on
	Gene Ontology), co-regulation (using transcription factor and microRNA
	target predictions) or co-location. The results of each analysis
	step can be visualized in a number of ways. The complete protocol
	can be executed in ≈1 h.},
